## Challenges

1. Try to make a menu popup when you click **Today's Menu** Button on the Restaurant Website Project - Project 5
2. I did not build the mobile version of the Admin Dashboard. Can you make one? I'd love to see it. Tag me on Twitter [@TSBSankara](https://twitter.com/TSBSankara) - Project 8
3. Make a functional mobile menu navbar on the Healthcare Website on Project 9
